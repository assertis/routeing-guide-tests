# National Routing Guide Tests

This repository contains a number of tests written in the [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference) syntax that can be used to check whether the [National Routeing Guide](http://data.atoc.org/routeing-guide) has been correctly applied to a journey.

Please note that due to topological and data changes the validity of the tests may change, but they should provide a good guide as to whether the rules have been implemented correctly.
